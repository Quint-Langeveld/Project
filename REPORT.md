## In General
This app helps the user to keep track of his/her own challenges and visualizes the results. The user retrieves notivications when to enter their succes of the challenge and how they feel at that moment. Afterwards and during the challenge this data is visualized in a pie-chart (Library from AnyChart) and in a line Graph (library from GraphView).

## Functionality

The first screen the user sees is the MainActivity. This is a modified App Theme throughout the app that removes the ActionBar at the top. There is a listView that uses a CursorAdapter to show just the ongoing challenges. When a right-swipeis detected via a GestureListener, the listView switches to another CursorAdapter that shows the finished challenges. Both adapters have a different onItemClick event. The ongoing challenges direct the user to the InputActivity to enter challengeValues that are stored inside a seperate SQLite database table. The onClick on finished challenges direct the user to the GraphActivity that shows the user all the data of a sertain challenge in two graphs. A pie-chart tht shows the success-rate of the challenge and a line-graph that shows the entered mood of the user troughout the time of the challenge. 

In the MainActivity the user can add a challenge to click on the floatingActionButton. Thereby the user gets directed to the EntryActivity. In here the user determines how long a the wanted challenge has to be followed and how often the user wants to be rememberd to it's challenge. This is done by Notifications. In the EntryActivity new instances of an AlarmManager (a reciever class) are created. The AlarmManager instances are activated by alarms and have two functions. First the notification and second to 'free' the InputActivity of a sertain challenge to be entered. This is because if this second function wasn't there, the user could finish a challenge in a minute of entering all the wanted datapoints. This function comes to play when the user clicks on a challenge in the ongoing listView. At first the app checks if the challenge is 'free' or 'locked'. This data is stored in the 'entries' table of the database. Then if the database notes 'free', the user is allowed to enter the InputActivity to fill in their mood. However, if the database notes 'locked', the user gets to see a pop-up message that tells them they have to wait a little longer. By entering the mood and succes in the InputActivity the challenge automatically sets to 'locked', so the AlarmManager has to unlock it when they recieve the next alarm.
